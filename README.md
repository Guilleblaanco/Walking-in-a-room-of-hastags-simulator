# Walking-in-a-room-of-hastags-simulator
After reading A Tour of C++ this is the first thing I've built with this language. I got the code from a YouTube tutorial because I actually still feel a bit lost with this language, but I'm currently trying to make some asteroids simulator from scratch, so this is just the beginning of a looong journey.

IMPORTANT: The code is not very responsive, you'll need to make some adjustments on the terminal dimensions if you want to see the walls well shaped.
